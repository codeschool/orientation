This project has no CHANGELOG, for the following reasons:

- It evolves quickly
- Its boundaries are not clearly defined
- The feature list is still in flux
- It's an app, not a library. Your code should depend on it.

That said, this project maintains a [NEWS][1] file with interesting 
new features.
